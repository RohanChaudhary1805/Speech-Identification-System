# Speech-Identification-System
- This repository contains code for a Speaker Identification System implemented in Python.
- The system utilizes Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) for feature extraction and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for speaker modeling.

- The folders *Testing_Audio* and *Voice_Samples_Training* have relevant testing and training data for the model and the *SpeechGMM* notebook contains the entire code
